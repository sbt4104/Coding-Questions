/*
Given a set of investment projects with their respective profits, we need to find the most profitable projects. We are given an initial capital and are allowed to invest only in a fixed number of projects. Our goal is to choose projects that give us the maximum profit.

We can start an investment project only when we have the required capital. Once a project is selected, we can assume that its profit has become our capital.
